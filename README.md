MySQL Script to Create Reports for Multiple Business Scenarios:
+ Analyze Youtube video trending patterns (i.e. which category trends the most).
+ Understand viewersâ€™ affinities for various categories/channels/tags.

In this project, I used MySQL to create a relational database, import the data from CSV and JSON files, and then extract different information to answer different business questions. The main questions include: 
+ Top Trending Categories
+ Ranking the Popularity of Each Category Partitioned by Each Month
